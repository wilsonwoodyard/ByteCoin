# ByteCoin
This is an app that I worked on as apart of my Udemy Bootcamp.

The image assets and starting UI were provided by the course as the focus of this app was to learn how to retrieve APIs, parse JSON and display the returned data on the user interface. All of the fuctionality was programmed by me.
